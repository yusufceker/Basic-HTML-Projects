What's HTML??


HTML cannot be defined as a programming language.Because a program that works on its own
cannot be written with HTML codes. Only programs that can run through programs that can interpret
this language can be written. This is exactly why cannot be called a programming language. The basic
requirement is to simply link different data such as text, images, videos and the pages cantaining 
them, in addition to determining the necessary rules for the pages in question to be displayed
properly by the web browser software. Web browsers read, interpret and render HTML code, so the same
HTML code is likely to produce different results in different browsers. When used with CSS and
JavaScript, visual and dynamic websites can be created through HTML.
